Excel to management clients, benefits and invoices for a very small enterprise or autonomous

This project have been create to help a french friend so all the fileds are in french. My friend is ergotherapist and needed something very simple to manage her clients and the appointment with them and she could control her benefits and her outstanding pacients. She had an Excel file to do this function so I decided mantein Excel but introducing some automatization (macros and formulas) to facilitate her the work.

The new Excel file have 5 parts:

- Part 1 - This is the first sheet and it's only to access to the diferent sheets like a link

- Part 2 - It is formed by 2 sheets and they are two databases:
    - Pacients
       - Have the diferent clients
       - One line is a unique client
       - The fields we wanted for further analysis are:
           - c
           - cc
    - Seances
       - Have the differents appoinments with the differents clients
       - It can have many lines for the same pacient
       - The fields we wanted for further analysis are:
            - cc
            - z
- Part 3 - It is formed by 3 sheets and they are the formularies to entry the information to the differents fileds of the databases sheets:
    - Formulaire Pacient
    - Formulaire Seance
    - Formulaire Facture

- Part 4 - This is a sheet to see individualy the relevant information of each pacient

- Part 5 - It is formed by 3 sheets and they are dashboards to visualizaice the important data of the 2 databases sheets
